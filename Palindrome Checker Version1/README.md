## Implementation Details

The JavaScript code (`script.js`) employs a classic `for` loop to compare characters from the left and right sides of the expression. The comparison is done by index, ensuring an efficient palindrome check.

## Reset Functionality
The 'Reset' button clears the input field and results, allowing for easy retesting.

## Notes
Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in your browser for the proper functioning of the Palindrome Checker.
